# Logout Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (Instructions)
- Created a file `backend-logout-route.md` with instructions for implementing a `/api/auth/logout` route on the backend
- The route should clear the token cookie using `res.clearCookie('token')`

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### AuthContext.jsx
- Added a `reset()` function that:
  - Clears user state
  - Removes flow ID from localStorage
  - Clears all contexts and stores (FlowManager, collaborationStore, taskStore, conditionStore, backendConfigStore)
- Updated the `logout()` function to:
  - Call the `/api/auth/logout` endpoint
  - Call the `reset()` function
  - Emit a 'logout' event to localStorage for cross-tab synchronization
- Added a `sessionCheck()` function to verify authentication status
- Added event listeners for:
  - `visibilitychange` to check session when tab becomes visible
  - `storage` to handle logout events from other tabs

#### App.jsx
- Added a `ProtectedRoute` component to check authentication status
- Protected routes that require authentication:
  - `/editor`
  - `/settings/backend`
  - `/settings/backend/:id`
  - `/settings/backend/new`
- Added a `/login` route that renders the `AuthPage` component
- Added redirect to `/login` when accessing protected routes without authentication
- Enhanced the `ProtectedRoute` component to save the current location when redirecting to login

#### AuthPage.jsx
- Added automatic redirection to the original requested page after successful login
- Added a "Continue to Editor" button for manual navigation
- Added location state handling to support the redirect-after-login flow

## Verification

All axios instances already have `withCredentials: true` set:
- In `src/context/AuthContext.jsx`
- In `src/utils/flowApiHelper.js`
- In `src/services/flowClient.ts`

No token-related localStorage usage was found that needed to be removed.

## How It Works

1. When a user clicks logout:
   - The frontend calls the backend `/api/auth/logout` endpoint
   - The backend clears the token cookie
   - The frontend resets all state and contexts
   - A 'logout' event is emitted to localStorage

2. For cross-tab synchronization:
   - When a user logs out in one tab, other tabs detect the 'logout' event
   - Other tabs reset their state and contexts
   - This ensures consistent logout across all tabs

3. Session verification:
   - On initial load and when a tab becomes visible, the app checks the session status
   - If the session is invalid, the user is redirected to the login page
   - This ensures the app stays in sync with the authentication state

4. Route protection:
   - Protected routes check if the user is authenticated
   - If not authenticated, the user is redirected to the login page
   - This prevents unauthorized access to protected routes
